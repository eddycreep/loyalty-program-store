# Legend Systems Loyalty Program

## Introduction

The **Legend Systems Loyalty Program** is a comprehensive solution designed to help retailers increase customer retention, boost sales, and gather valuable insights into customer behavior. 

Unlike traditional points-based systems, our program uses a **tier-based discount approach** that offers customers immediate value while encouraging repeat business through progressive rewards.

Developed by **Legend Systems**, a trusted South African technology provider since 1992, this loyalty solution integrates seamlessly with our suite of retail management products, including **LegendLite™**, **LegendPro™**, and **LegendElite™**.
